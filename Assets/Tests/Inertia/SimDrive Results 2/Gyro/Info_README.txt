For anybody interested:

Thats a visualisation on what impact the inertia tensor has on rotation and nicely shows the staggering that can occur.
All three models are exactly the same except for the tensor in the blue 3D mass in the middle.
One is the 424 Tensor with only the diagonal axis filled, the rest is zero.
The second is the real 42 tensor.
The third is the full 424 tensor with ten times higher I_YZ/I_ZY.

The simulation is simple - the gyro is initally in rest and standing vertically straight.
Directly after the start I apply 1000 [Nm] of torque on the tip around the vertical axis for 0.1 [s] and let it spin for 30 [s].
No friction, no gravity.
